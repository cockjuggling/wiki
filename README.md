## wiki

This is a collection of Markdown documents that I previously used to cut up and post into tourist queries for Edinburgh.

This has now been broken into specific catagories. 

Older URLs in these files use Bitly which was done when I used to hit the 10,000 character posting limit. I have not been motivated to change these back to normal URLs, but will over time. 
Newer updates to this doc use normal URLs for specific companies/ vendors.
