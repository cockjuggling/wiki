# Workspaces & Hotdesking

The city has a number of locations where you can sit with your laptop and work. Some cafes discourage the use of their premises to work as it blocks tables. So, the list below is a number of co-working spaces or hotdesking facilities. If costs are available, they'll be mentioned.
