# Internet & Mobile Services

There are a few methods of gaining internet access in Edinburgh:  

1. Via an Internet Service Provider. Depending on location in Edinburgh your options may be limited to ADSL (rare), Fibre to the Cabinet or Fibre to the Premises (Full Fibre). [Check availability](http://www.superfast-openreach.co.uk/where-and-when/) of services if you know the post code of the property you are moving into. Provisioning of service may take a week and will no doubt require access to the property. Plan this in if you decide to order services, but have not taken possession of keys. If new service is being provisioned it may involve drilling holes into the property. Please seek your landlord's permission before advising any installation team.
   1. [USwitch](https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/) provide a broadband comparison site.
   2. [Money Saving Expert](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/compare-broadband-deals/) also provides their own price comparison site.

2. Via [Virgin Media](http://www.virginmedia.com) who don't cover all the properties but offer cable connections over their own network. They have a variety of speed packages from 125Mbps to 1Gbps.
3. [HyperOptic](https://www.hyperoptic.com/) operate their own fibre network within Edinburgh, but their coverage is very limited. They do provide a Postcode checker for you to check if they operate in the area you are moving into.
4. [CityFibre](https://cityfibre.com/availability) also operate in Edinburgh, but again with a limited network - utilising their postcode checker will allow you to see if service can be obtained in your area. 
5. 5G internet service has vastly improved and can be an option if you are a light internet user and do not plan to stay long (ie. you can't commit to a 12 month contract). Below are a list of 5G operators to consider.
   1. [Three](https://www.three.co.uk/broadband/home-broadband)
   2. [EE](https://ee.co.uk/broadband/mobile-broadband)
   3. [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.co.uk/gigacube?icmp=uk~1_consumer~topnav~2_why_vodafone~3_5g~5_5g_broadband&linkpos=topnav~1~2~3~5)

Most of the communication companies above will try to tie you in long-term contracts (typically 24 months) that you cannot exit from without facing a penalty, or paying off the contract. You should try to avoid this, it may cost you more but you will regret it less. Test a provider before you commit to them.
