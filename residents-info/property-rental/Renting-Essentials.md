## Essentials

## How to search properties

### Big property search aggregators

There are websites to use that will have access to 99% of the available properties in and close to Edinburgh:  

* [Zoopla](http://www.zoopla.co.uk)
* [City Lets](http://www.citylets.co.uk)
* [Letting Web](http://www.lettingweb.com)
* [Rightmove](http://www.rightmove.co.uk)
* [ESPC](http://www.espc.com)

  These sites mainly contain properties from professional letting agents, who act on behalf of a landlord (this is the British word for "property owner"). Some of these sites allow you to see the properties on a map, and this is a very handy feature. No self-respecting agent has properties available who are not posted online at all. Physically visiting an agent's shop is pretty much pointless.  

### Privately rented accommodation

* [Gumtree](http://www.gumtree.com/flats-and-houses-for-rent/edinburgh) - mainly contains property from private landlords and some rooms to let (more about these later)  
* [Spare Room](http://www.spareroom.co.uk) - mainly rooms to let

## Where to live

Edinburgh is generally very safe and you will be fine most of the time. There are a few areas to be avoided and they are nicely coloured on various maps:

* Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivations
  * [This one](https://simd.scot/#/simd2020/BTTTFTT/11/-3.2883/55.9266/) shows you specific problems of every area, it is complex to use but more detailed. The data set used here is form 2020 and is subject to change.

## Transportation

Transportation costs should factor into your budgeting. If you need to use the bus services daily, you will need a bus pass (costs £40 month for student, £51 for everyone else). IF you take into account commuting time, a cheaper flat may just not worth it in the end. If your university or work place is in the outskirts of Edinburgh, you should still target to live in the city centre, because this is where the fun is and otherwise you will end up isolated and not making the most of your time here (Herriot-Watt students are subject to this problem). Just make sure you're living near a bus that takes you to your daily destination instead of living outside Edinburgh.  

Another thing to consider is local amenities. For example, it is better to live near a large super market and it will probably save you money in the long run (buy your food every day rather than takeaway). There are many small super markets but usually the range of products on offer is boring and suited for people who don't have time to cook.  

## How to move around

Edinburgh has great bus coverage and a recently opened, yet quite useless, tram line. There is no underground. Wherever you are, you're not far away from a bus stop and there would be a bus coming very frequently. Many bus services run every 10 or 20 minutes, it is only a few that run every 30'. You can use Google Maps to see the bus stops near buy and be able to ask it to give you directions on your typical destinations (e.g. your campus) using public transport. However, using the buses daily can be pricey, so many people prefer to rent near their regular daily destination and just walk there. There are some very helpful apps:  

* [Google maps](https://maps.google.co.uk/) - tells you where you need to go and which buses will take you there  

* Official Bus Tracker and eTickets - [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bus-tram/id6468092588) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=travel.ticketless.app.lothian&pcampaignid=web_share)

Using a car is not popular and not recommended. The traffic is not that much but parking is horrible. Also, owning a car in the UK will cost A LOT in insurance (we're talking £1000/year just for that) and the car's value depreciates very fast. Generally a very bad option for newcomers, unless if your workplace is in the middle of nowhere. You also have to drive on the left.  

Cycling is a reasonably good option for the adventurous. You will get the occasional asshole driver but most drivers are good and calm. There is reasonably good cycle lane network.  Edinburgh also has brought back the [bike rental scheme](https://www.voi.com/how-to-voi) in summer 2025. This service is operated by VOI. [Fares for utilising this service are available online](https://www.voi.com/pricing-and-passes).

## Procedure to find a flat

### Long before you arrive (I will call this day "T")

You need to book a hotel or somewhere to stay when you arrive and for a period of at least one, preferably two weeks. This is the time required for finding a property and signing the contracts. You will probably not need the full two weeks but better safe than sorry. You should do this as long in advance as possible, to get cheaper prices. If you are a student, you may be able to find a place at university accommodation at off-term periods (e.g. early September).  

### T minus 15 days

15 days before you move to Edinburgh, have a very good look at the property websites mentioned above and understand what is going on. Get familiar with the areas, the prices how they relate with the kinds of properties etc. This is your initial approach, do not arrange anything yet.  

### T minus 7 days

For the whole week before you arrive, check the websites for properties that have been **just added** in the website. Anything older will be gone by the time you are here, or it is total rubbish. Avoid flats that don't have many pictures, there must be a reason for that. Call the agents of the properties you like and arrange a viewing for the day after you arrive (T+1) or as soon as possible thereafter. Time the viewings wisely to do as many as you can on this day, use Google Maps to get travel time information by bus or walk and add about 30' buffer in case you get lost or miss the bus. If you are concerned about using Google Maps on roaming, you can either print your plans for the day and maps or just walk into a news agent and buy a pre-paid SIM card for your phone (don't forget to plan time for this, maybe you should do it on the day you arrive anyway - GifGaff is good). Do **not** think that you can hire a car at the airport and use it for your flat hunting, it is going to be very expensive and parking is extremely difficult to find (and expensive). If you think you can't use the bus, then it would be better to use taxis than hiring a car.  

### Day T+1

So, you landed at day T, you had a good sleep, wake up and hit the viewings. If you see a flat you like, ask what is the agent's process for securing it, it usually requires an application to be submitted with identity documents etc. Remember: fees are illegal. Some agents ask you to pay a "holding fee" which is later deduced from your deposit, this is fine as long as it is **immediately** refundable if THEY decide not to give you the flat - ask the details and what is their method of refunding it, bank checks would be no good since you don't have a bank account to cash them in. If you decide to apply, you should do this on the same day or first thing the day after. DO NOT DELAY as somebody else may view it in the meanwhile and apply first, in which case you may lose your priority. You should be looking to find SOMEWHERE reasonable, not THE BEST place, you can look for a better place in 6 months (see contracts).  

### Further to T+1

 If you did not find anything on day T+1 then you can begin to worry and relax at the same time. Worry because you're quickly running out of time, relax because there is nothing you can do but repeat the searches online and find more properties, arrange viewings ASAP etc. It would also help to become slightly less picky about what you are looking for at this stage, remember, you can move our in just 6 months.  

### If you can't find something within 7 working days 

Book another 5 working days in the hotel you're are staying or elsewhere, it is nearly impossible to secure a let in less than 5 working days so you will probably need the extra days.  

### Letting a room only

You may have noticed a lot of hurdles in renting a property when you are a first mover. This is why many people chose to just rent a room and live with strangers, and there is nothing wrong with that. There are literally a million rooms available and they can be found on gumtree. The process involves a viewing and also some small talk to see whether you fit with the other tenants. Usually people try to match like with like, undergraduate students, postgraduate students, young professionals, females, males, tobacco smokers, weed smokers, non-smokers, gays, etc are all groups of people who may be looking for similar flatmates. A landlord, of course, exists but most likely they don't live in the property. He or she will, however, require deposits, guarantors etc, same as a typical agent, but it is the tenants who choose you (because they can, if it's not you, it will be the next guy coming up in half an hour).  

### Private landlords and smaller agents

Private landlords occupy a big market as well. They are usually found in gumtree and they vary from total sloppy and illegal to quite professional. The hint to distinguish them is whether they ask for any fees (therefore are happy to break the law) and also their overall professionalism. Every landlord, including private ones, must have a landlord registration number and you can check a flat's address against this number on [this website](https://www.landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk/Pages/Process.aspx?Command=ShowHomePage), to see if they have the right to rent this flat. There are many scammers. DO NOT SEND ANY MONEY UNLESS IF YOU HAVE CHECKED THE LANDLORD REGISTRATION NUMBER AND HAVE SIGNED A CONTRACT.  

### Student halls

Universities provide accommodation in student halls. This is a very good option if you are an 18-year-old fresher but it becomes less and less good as you grow older.  

### Furnished/Unfurnished properties

Furnished properties outnumber unfurnished properties 10-1. Unfurnished usually includes a cooker, fridge and washing machine. Dishwashers are rare in all properties - you're lucky if you get one.  

### Which floor?

Basement flats exist in Edinburgh, you can survive in one for six months, especially if you are on a budget. (security precautions of groud-floor flats apply). If you're in a good area, basement flats are fine, just watch out for damp. You might want to invest in a dehumidifier if you're staying for a while.  

If you get a ground floor flat (this is at the street level), make sure it is double-glazed. This deters opportunistic burglars who are after your laptop. Also, keep your curtains closed (make sure the flat has curtains) and be prepared to endure some noise if in a busy area.  

First and second floor flats are the best, not too many flights of stairs to climb.  

You will regret any third floorer higher flat every time you come back to it. Lifts are very rare in Edinburgh.  

### Students and professionals

Many flats are designated for students or professionals. A professional may rent a student flat but not the opposite. Flats for professionals are usually more expensive but better. Be ware that if a professional lets a flat with other students, he/she will have to pay council tax but students flatmates won't agree to share that bill.  

### How agents select tenants

Most properties receive multiple applications and the agent assess your financial situation/status before they decide who is the least risky. You cannot easily influence that but if you are a professional with a good job offer you should be fine. (also, make a good impression at the viewing)  

### Smoking

If you are a smoker do not say so and don't smoke right before the viewings, even if you don't plan to smoke in the flat. Most landlords don't like smokers and that may be in your contract as well. It is a big risk if you smoke in the flat, in case you cause a fire you will pay the damages yourself (which of course can be many thousands of pounds).  

### Pets

Pets are generally not allowed on rented accommodation. You may find some landlords who would let you bring a pet but they will almost certainly have you pay a higher deposit and/or other hurdles.  

### Contracts

Contracts usually last for 6 months, sometimes more, and then enter a "monthly" or "bi-monthly" rolling period. That means you can exit the contract as long as you give one or two months notice. Some flats come with fixed length contracts, usually expiring in July. Exceptions are possible and you should always check your contract terms.  

### Evictions

If your landlord wants you to go, he must do so formally, via a court procedure called eviction. This applies even if your initial term of the contract has elapsed. They cannot just tell you to leave, no matter why. They also need to give you enough time to do so (i.e. to find somewhere else). Do not make your live difficult if you don't have to.  

### Troubleshooting

If your property has a small problem, you should complain to the agent/landlord until it is fixed. By complain we mean call them every day, visit their shop etc. Do **not** withhold the rent as a means of pushing them as this is illegal and gives them a method to evict you. If the property has a big problem (e.g. a broken window) then you have laws covering you and it should be fixed immediately. Most agents will have a 24-hour emergency lines for things like water leaks and/or if you lost your keys (they will charge you in this last case).  

### Deposits and guarantors

Almost all landlords will ask for a deposit. This deposit should be stored with a deposit protection scheme. Scotland has three operators currently. 

* [Letting Protecion Scotland](https://www.lettingprotectionscotland.com/)
* [My Deposits Scotland](https://www.mydepositsscotland.co.uk/)
* [Safe Deposits Scotland](https://www.safedepositsscotland.com/)

 This is usually one month's worth of rent and it is refundable **after** you leave the flat and **after** the landlord/agent has checked that everything is in good condition. Some agents will let you be present when the final inspection happens and you may even get the option for a pre-inspection to make things right if you ask - do ask. Deposits cannot be more than 2 month's rent. 

 If damage is detected at the point of exiting your rented property repairs to the property are taken from your deposit before the remainder of it is returned to you. Should you believe that the damage being claimed for is inaccurate, or overpriced you can appeal the costs and have this assessed based on your presented evidence and that take at check-out.

If you are a student, you need a guarantor. The guarantor must be a UK resident for over 3 years and receive a salary or pension. If you do not have a guarantor, look for the few agents who allow a higher deposit or ask you to pay 6 months of rent up-front. You should be able to ask this when you call to arrange the viewings.  

If you are a professional with a job offer, they will need to see that offer and/or they will call the employer for confirmation. If you are going to be on probation, your offer is not worth anything to them. You better ask the agent for advice (most likely you will need a guarantor, same as the students).  

### Bills

Heating is a big part of your monthly bills, Edinburgh is cold and old flats are not well insulated. Most heat is released from cracks in the windows, hence double-glazed/modern windows are superior to the old wooden ones. Flats with gas heating (also called central heating or gas central heating or GCH) are cheaper to keep warm and so are flats with double glazing. The number of windows and their size also plays an important role. Electric heating is to be avoided, unless if you have no choice.  

Properties in scotland pay tax to the local government, known as Council Tax. Each property is classified in a band and the amounts for each band are available [here](http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20005/council_tax/620/council_tax_bands_and_charges). This cost is usually not included in the property's rent (unless if the property is advertised as "all bills inclusive") yet it should be taken into account, as it can vary between two very similar properties. Students are exempt from this charge while if you live alone (or all your other flatmates are students) you can claim 25% discount. You will have to apply to the City Council before you're granted an exception or discount.  

### Insurance

You'll need your own insurance to cover your possessions in the flat, called 'contents insurance'. Expect to pay around £10 per month. The landlord will insure the building and their fixtures, fittings and furniture themselves. You do not have to buy insurance but peace of mind is a great thing.  

### Other useful information

1. It is illegal for letting agents in Scotland to charge **any** money for **anything** other than rent or deposit in order to secure a property rental. Agents call these fees with many names like "credit checks" and they may give a number of excuses as to why they charge them (read: "we use an external company"). An agent charging fees means they are happy to break the law and if they do so in this case then they may be happy to break the law in other cases - don't use them.  
2. It is nearly impossible to find a hotel or anywhere for a reasonable prince in August. Edinburgh has a number of festivals going on simultaneously in August and the city is full of festival goers and tourists, we're talking seriously full here, basically no hope. If you cannot change your arrival to a time other than August, make sure you book as much in advance as possible and hope for the best. September is busy as well, because students without somewhere to live arrive. However, it is less busy than August.
3. It is a landlord's market, you will feel hopeless at times.  
4. Flats are old and staircases dirty. You should consider the staircase as part of the street and not expect much.  
5. European Laws allow buyers of remote services to claim a refund. For this reason, professional agents **will not agree** to let you in a flat (nor take any money from you) unless if you have seen the flat - they are not crazy. If someone offers you to accept money while you have not seen the flat then **consider it a scam and don't send money**.  
6. Landlords **must** send your deposit to a "Deposit Protection Scheme", which is basically a company that keeps it safe. This company also manages any disputes between landlord and tenant when the tenant leaves.  
7. When you move-in to your new flat **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING WITH PICTURES**. And I mean **EVERYTHING**. Every wall, every window, every carpet, every room, every piece of furniture. It will take you one hour but it can save you loads of money should there is a dispute about the condition of the flat when you leave. Once you take the pictures, send a copy to your agent or landlord and have them agree that this is indeed the condition of the flat. Agents also have a way to document a property's condition by means of a property inventory but this is usually just a document without pictures. By the way, you should double-check that document as well and submit any comments within the period stated there, otherwise you would be assumed to accept it as it is.
8. The best source for general information about tenancy rights is [Shelter](http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice).  
9. Most letting agents will perform inspections during your tenancy, usually every 3 or 6 months but that varies. Landlords or agents are not allowed to enter the property you rent without your permission, unless in an emergency. You can just not let them in if you don't want.  
10. All contracts will say that subletting your flat is not allowed and that is true. However, nobody can stop you from inviting non-paying guests (like friends or family or even couch surfers) should you want to.  
11. One-bedroom flats are very difficult to find, even more in September. If you can afford it, consider a two-bedroom flat, it may be as little as just £50 more expensive.  
12. If you are overseas, don't expect letting agents to show any interest in you. They are inundated with emails and phone calls from overseas students and visitors and the rental market here moves fast. Once you are here and able to view properties, they will be more help.  
13. Bear in mind when dealing with agents that you are not the customer. "I have money to spend and they are not interested" is commonly heard in this sub, but the agent's customer is the owner of the property. The agent doesn't make any money from you (at least they don't if they are following the law).  
14. Every agent you speak to, tell them what you are looking for and ask them to call you if something becomes available. They may not, but it is worth asking. If you have a UK mobile number, you're more likely to get a call back. If not, give your number as it needs to be dialled in the UK. Don't leave it to the agent to work out what your country code is, because they won't bother.  
15. If you find your flat before you have finished viewing all the other flats you have arranged, please call the agents and cancel the appointments. It is polite and it will help other people who are looking as well.  

16. You need to show proof of income and/or a job offer. If you can't meet the income requirements, you need a guarantor. 90% of places will only take a UK-based guarantor, so if you're not from the UK you're fucked. Basically you need to go private and pay 6 months in full.

17. Flats are in high demand some with 50+ applicants. Expect to go to a lot of showings and unless you're a great candidate on paper, expect to be denied.

18. To actually be chosen to get a showing, respond with more than, "I'm interested in seeing the flat, can I schedule a viewing?" Tell them why you're a good candidate so they will pick you out of the 100+ enquiries they receive per flat. I told them about my job, savings, plans to live there for 3+ years, etc. Make yourself look good to get your foot in the door.

19. Property viewings rarely occur on a weekend or any time after 4pm. Property agents have no reason to work at odd times because there are already 50 other people wanting the flat that can show up during business hours. Keep in mind you will not be able to flat hunt and work a 9-5 M-F. Also, they'll sometimes email you asking for a showing that afternoon. Take it if you can, because it could be gone by the following day.

20. Rents for a 1 bedroom anywhere within 2 miles of the city centre may not be found for less than £700 PCM. Doesn't matter how much of a dump it is, it'll be £700 or more unless you want to live in Livingston or something.

### If you're renting a room

Make sure the landlord has a [Landlord Registration Number](https://landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk/) and that you are presented with and sign a real tenancy agreement! Edinburgh unfortunately is blighted with slum landlords. You have no tenant rights if your landlord is not a real landlord and there is no tenancy agreement

A lot of rooms for rent have bills included, but some do not so consider this and plan accordingly with your budget. Currently, it is unlikely you will find anything under £500 all included within 2 miles of the city centre. Expect when moving here to pay £550-700/mo total for rent, council tax, and utilities. You will probably pay less if you live somewhere like further out of the city.

If you are a student I highly recommend getting student housing your first year. It's expensive, it's not ideal, but it's so much easier than the stress and headache you have to deal with trying to find a place here. The timing is particularly bad because you have Fringe in August so everyone is renting out any bed or couch they have... then in September, you're competing with all the other new and returning students (there are four universities in Edinburgh).

### UK bank account required

It is very difficult to do anything without a UK bank account, including renting a place. Unfortunately, you need an address to get a UK bank account. Challenger banks such as [Monzo](https://www.monzo.com/) or [Starling](https://www.starlingbank.com/) may be easier to apply and get a bank account. However, a bricks and mortar bank may also be a better option. For example, HSBC offer a [bank account for International Student](https://www.hsbc.co.uk/current-accounts/products/international-student/). 

#### Other Bricks and Mortar banks operating in Edinburgh to apply for a bank account

* [Bank of Scotland](https://www.bankofscotland.co.uk)
* [Royal Bank of Scotland](https://www.rbs.co.uk)/ [NatWest](https://www.natwest.com/)
* [Virgin Money](https://uk.virginmoney.com/), formerly Clydesdale Bank
* [TSB](http://www.tsb.co.uk/)
* [Santander](https://www.santander.co.uk/)
  
If you don't like the place you're at, you can give 28 days notice. There are no more 6 month lease requirements, that's not even an option with new tenant laws.

This city currently has a BRUTAL housing market. Godspeed to any of you trying to move here right now.
