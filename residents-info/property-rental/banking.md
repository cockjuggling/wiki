# UK bank accounts

It is very difficult to do anything without a UK bank account, including renting a place. Unfortunately, you need an address to get a UK bank account. Challenger banks such as [Monzo](https://www.monzo.com/) or [Starling](https://www.starlingbank.com/) may be easier to apply and get a bank account. However, a bricks and mortar bank may also be a better option. For example, HSBC offer a [bank account for International Student](https://www.hsbc.co.uk/current-accounts/products/international-student/).
