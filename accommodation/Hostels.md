# Hostels

Edinburgh has numerous hostels for the frugal and weary traveller. 
Usage of sites such as [HostelWorld](https://www.hostelworld.com/hostels/europe/scotland/edinburgh/) may be useful to find availability over a number of locations in the city. However, if you wish to contact hostels directly, then a list is noted below.

I cannot however provide a recoomendation for any of these hostels as I am an Edinburgh resident and don't require local accommodation. Please do your own research for reviews and feedback.
