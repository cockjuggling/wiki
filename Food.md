# Food

I am not going to give any recommendations — in Edinburgh there are simply too many to mention. Below is a small subset of "Locally" owned establishments. I will not make mention of national chains or franchises of which there are many to pick and choose from it you like. 

Cheap:

* [Mum's Comfort Food](https://www.monstermashcafe.co.uk/) - Forrest Road - previously this was Monster Mash where it brought Sausages, Mash and Gravy an excellent meal choice. 
* [City Cafe](https://www.thecitycafe.co.uk/) - Blair Street - Another comfort food venue
* [Oink](https://www.oinkhogroast.co.uk/) - Canongate - Glorious pig rolls

Pricey:

* [Scran and Scallie](https://scranandscallie.com/) - Comely Bank Rd - "Rustic Gastro Pub" — owned by Tim Kitchin.  However, some of the [working practices of Tim Kitchin might detract](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/02/tom-kitchin-restaurant-staff-suspended-bullying-allegations-toxic-workplace-social-media-claims) from his culinary achievements. 
* [Six by Nico](https://www.sixbynico.co.uk/edinburgh/) - Hanover Street - 6 course tasting menu that changes often to other regions. This is very much a marmite restaurants with the reddit community.

* [The Purslane](http://www.purslanerestaurant.co.uk/) - St Stephen St, Edinburgh

* [Le Petit Beef Bar](https://beefbar.com/le-petit-beefbar-edinburgh/) - George Street, Edinburgh

Thai:
