## **Things NOT to do:**

* Do not visit Greyfriar's Bobby [and rub his nose](http://bit.ly/3Xl4C4W). This does not give you good luck, in fact it has been done so much that it has damaged the statue now.
* Don't go to Greyfriar's Graveyard and [steal a headstone](http://bit.ly/3XrMs1w).
* The same applies to the David Hume Statue and his toe - again, its not lucky to rub it and it's damaging the statue.
* Don't walk 3 abreast in groups and stop dead in the street to look at something. This blocks the pavement for other pedestrians who get mightily frustrated if they are also looking to get somewhere. 
* Don't hire a car for your travels around Edinburgh. We have one of the best bus networks in the UK.

## **Items to bring with you**:

* Buy a [waterproof jacket](http://bit.ly/3Wc9GHE) and bring it with you, rather than an umbrella. The weather can be unpredictable and with that umbrellas won't last long if the wind picks up!
* Bring sunscreen, less relevant in the winter months — you might not need it, but it's better to have than not as the hazy sun is deceptive and can lead to a skelpt heid. 
* Sunglasses - There might not be many hours of daylight, and it might not be a day the sun comes out, but when it does and it's low in the sky it can be quite dazzling. 

**Transport within Edinburgh**

Edinburgh has very good transport links within the city and further afield. 

* [Transport for Edinburgh](http://bit.ly/3XyeQz3)
  * [Lothian Buses](http://bit.ly/3QCc6hA) - Journey planner for getting round the city - [Tickets](http://bit.ly/3kdWkh4) - You can use your contactless card to hop on the bus — they operate "Tap Tap Cap" — which should see you spend no more than a day ticket for unlimited travel in the city per day.
  * [Edinburgh Trams](http://bit.ly/3ILpCh0) - for transit from the Airport to the City Centre - [Fare Finder](https://bit.ly/3Rvq9Xp). [Mobile App](https://bit.ly/3ROF0xn) for tickets.
  * [City Cabs](http://bit.ly/3CL0gfz) - Black Cab - [Book a Taxi](https://bit.ly/3IVcplM).
  *  Uber X - Book via App. [Price Estimator](http://bit.ly/3Zyu8W6).

**Guided Coach Tours outwith Edinburgh** 

There are a number of minibus/ coach tours that leave from Edinburgh to a wide variety of destinations beyond Edinburgh. If you want to cram in a good number of sights into a few days - then this is the best way to do it.

* [Go Scotland Tours](http://bit.ly/3CHWLGv)
* [Highland Explorer Tours](http://bit.ly/3CPF87R)

**Hotels**

I cannot provide any recommendations for hotels with included spas - I'm a resident and don't need hotel accommodation. There are however lots of hotels dotted around the city. There is surely one to meet your budget and star rating. Usage of [Hotels.com](https://bit.ly/3vdhTUj) or [Trivago](https://bit.ly/4avGT9x) should give you a good idea of whats available. Chain hotels such as [Yotel](https://bit.ly/46ADgfY), [Motel One](https://bit.ly/3QnngZ9), [Novotel](https://bit.ly/3FmLexn), [Raddison](https://bit.ly/490yEBK), [Travelodge](https://bit.ly/48blGAf), [Premier Inn](https://bit.ly/48mieT0) and [Ibis](https://bit.ly/485eF3M) may not use these hotel comparison sites and it may be better served to check them separately for a deal or promotion they might have active.

**Fringe** \- I'm not going to tell you what to see, but here are some of the venues. Edfringe has a decent enough search to filter all the shows in the Fringe Festival.

* [EdFringe](https://bit.ly/3Rt8gIE) - Primary site for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It will have a searchable database of all acts participating as part of the Fringe - they also have an allocation of tickets for each and every show — however, if a show is showing as sold out here, doesn't mean it's "sold out". Venues hold their own ticket allocations
* [Underbelly](https://bit.ly/3tEVpep) - One of the big 4 fringe venues run by Ed Bartlam and Charlie Wood. They have in recent years also managed the Edinburgh's Christmas markets

* [Gilden Balloon](https://bit.ly/3NHuZzE) - One of the big 4 fringe venues
