# **Food**

I am not going to give any recommendations — in Edinburgh there are simply too many to mention. Below is a small subset of "Locally" owned establishments. I will not make mention of national chains or franchises of which there are many to pick and choose from it you like. 

Cheap:

* [Mum's Comfort Food](https://bit.ly/41CRyLn) - Forrest Road - previously this was Monster Mash where it brought Sausages, Mash and Gravy an excellent meal choice. 
* [City Cafe](https://bit.ly/477g6NW) - Blair Street - Another comfort food venue
* [Oink](http://bit.ly/3mm7Gkk) - Canongate - Glorious pig rolls

Pricey:

* [Scran and Scallie](https://bit.ly/3Rvmwk6) - Comely Bank Rd - "Rustic Gastro Pub" — owned by Tim Kitchin. 

  However, some of the [working practices of Tim Kitchin might detract](https://bit.ly/3TqRk8h) from his culinary achievements. 
  

* [Six by Nico](https://bit.ly/3RZFEZr) - Hanover Street - 6 course tasting menu that changes often to other regions. This is very much a marmite restraunt with the reddit community

Thai:

* [Ting Thai Caravan Club](https://bit.ly/3Rz7qKl) - Teviot Place - Shared seating Thai eatery. Always busy but for a reason - it's great for a quick eat, when you can get a seat.
