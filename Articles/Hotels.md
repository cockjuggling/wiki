## **Hotels**

I cannot provide any recommendations for hotels with included spas - I'm a resident and don't need hotel accommodation. There are however lots of hotels dotted around the city. There is surely one to meet your budget and star rating. Usage of [Hotels.com](https://bit.ly/3vdhTUj) or [Trivago](https://bit.ly/4avGT9x) should give you a good idea of whats available. Chain hotels such as [Yotel](https://bit.ly/46ADgfY), [Motel One](https://bit.ly/3QnngZ9), [Novotel](https://bit.ly/3FmLexn), [Raddison](https://bit.ly/490yEBK), [Travelodge](https://bit.ly/48blGAf), [Premier Inn](https://bit.ly/48mieT0) and [Ibis](https://bit.ly/485eF3M) may not use these hotel comparison sites and it may be better served to check them separately for a deal or promotion they might have active.
