## Private Car

Car hire is possible, but not recommended. Especially if you are staying within the city centre. Edinburgh operates a 7 day a week on-street controlled parking zone in the city centre. The cost of which can be eye-watering if you plan to leave the car there for extended periods. There are a variety of parking structures around the city operated by private companies (noted below). They may offer discounted parking for extended stays.

* [Q-Park](https://www.q-park.co.uk/en-gb/).
  * [Omni Centre Parking](https://omniedinburgh.co.uk/brand-directory/q-park-omni).
* [NCP](https://www.ncp.co.uk/).
  * [St John's Hill](https://www.ncp.co.uk/find-a-car-park/car-parks/edinburgh-st-johns-hill/).
  * [Castle Terrace](https://www.ncp.co.uk/find-a-car-park/car-parks/edinburgh-castle-terrace/).

## Low Emission Zone

This is largely irrelevant to tourists who hire cars as they will be compliant, but Edinburgh operates a Low Emission Zone within the core of the city. Further details of this zone and the fines if you enter it in a non-compliant vehicle can be [found here](https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/lowemissionzone).
