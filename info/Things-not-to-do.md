# Things NOT to do while visiting our fair city

* Do not visit Greyfriar's Bobby [and rub his nose](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-29850227). This does not give you good luck, in fact it has been done so much that it has damaged the statue now.
* The same applies to the David Hume Statue and his toe - again, its not lucky to rub it and it's damaging the statue.
* Don't go to Greyfriar's Graveyard and [steal a headstone](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/headstone-stolen-edinburgh-graveyard-police-27865361).
* Don't walk 3 abreast in groups and stop dead in the street to look at something. This blocks the pavement for other pedestrians who get mightily frustrated if they are also looking to get somewhere.
* Don't hire a car for your travels around Edinburgh.
  * Edinburgh has one of the best public bus networks in the UK.
