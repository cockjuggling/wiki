This is a short list of items you should consider bringing with you, or sourcing once you get to Edinburgh. This is NOT an exhaustive list. 

* Buy a [waterproof jacket](https://www.macinasac.com/collections/packable-jackets) and bring it with you, rather than an umbrella. The weather can be unpredictable and with that umbrellas won't last long if the wind picks up. If you forget to pack a waterproof layer - Fear not as Edinburgh has numerous retailers to sell you such products.
